Looking to contribute something to do? **Here's how you can help.**

Please take a moment to review the guidelines below.

## General Conduct

Please respect the following rules:

- Please **do not** derail or troll issues or PR's. Keep the discussion on topic and
  respect the opinions of others.

- Please **do not** post comments consisting solely of "+1" or ":thumbsup:". Use [GitHub's "reactions" feature](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments) instead. We will delete comments that violate this rule.

- **Absolutely No** foul language, swearing, or name-calling. Comments that violate this rule will be edited to remove the offensive language or deleted by the moderators.

## Bug reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by our code.

Guidelines for bug reports:

0. Make sure the issue isn't caused by an error in your own code.
1. Please search to make sure the issue hasn't already been reported by someone else.
1. Make sure you can reproduce the issue using the current `master` branch. The issue may have been fixed since the last release.

Please try to be extremely detailed in your report. List the **exact** steps to reproduce the issue. If you can include tests, that would be great!

## Pull requests

Good pull requests are a great help to the project.

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g. adding a new feature, refactoring code, etc.), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that we might not want to merge into the project.

Please run `npm test` to test your changes before submitting a PR.

**IMPORTANT**: By submitting a patch, you agree to allow the project owners to license your work under the terms of the [MIT License](LICENSE).

## Labels

Our bug tracker uses several labels to help organize and identify issues. Here's what they mean:

- `bug` - Issues that have been confirmed as an actual bug or a PR that fixes a bug.
- `docs` - Issues and PR's for improving or updating the docs.
- `coverage` - Issues and PR's pertaining to unit tests or code coverage.
- `enhancement` - Issues asking for an enhancement or new feature that we would welcome a PR implmenting; or a PR implementing an enhancement.
- `help wanted` - Issues that we need help fixing. If you want to work on an issue like this, please tell us so we can remove the label.
- `meta` - Issues with the project itself or the GitHub repository.
- `duplicate`, `question`, `wontfix` - Self-explanitory.
